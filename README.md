# FDS-Project-BREAST-CANCER-PREDICTION-
 Breast Cancer Prediction :This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on clinical features of breast cell nuclei. The goal is to assist in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, improving chances of successful treatment.
Importing: Loaded essential libraries – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Loading the Dataset: Used load_breast_cancer() from Scikit-learn.

Structure of the Dataset: Viewed using head(), tail(), info(), and describe().

Handling Missing Values: Checked with isnull().sum() – no missing values found.

Preprocessing: Added target column, separated features (X) and labels (Y).

Cleaning: Ensured proper formatting, no nulls, and correct data types.

Visualizations: Used count plots and group means to understand class distribution.

Solution for the Problem Statement: Built a simple Neural Network model to classify tumors as benign or malignant based on the input features.
